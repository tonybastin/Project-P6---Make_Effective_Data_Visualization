# Summary

A data visualization of survivability of passenger's in the Titanic dataset based on their class of travel, gender and age is visualized in this project. The html files used for this visualization is [index.html]() and the data file is [MyData.csv]()

## Design

A stacked bar charts showing percentages of passengers survived in each group was chosen to represent the data rather than the counts as it makes it easier to identify the survival rate in each group.

Color was removed from the bar chart as it was not conveying any extra information.

The X and Y axis for each bar chart were clearly marked and legends were also given for each group to show the information they were conveying.

The actual percentage values of passenger survival in each group can be noted by hovering over the bars.


## Feedback

1. To show the effect of survivability of passengers based on their age group,
passenger class and gender, it is best to use percentage values of passengers
deceased versus survived rather than the counts.
2. Color is not required since you need to show only the survived and deceased
percentages and this can be well represented by shades of black and white.
3. It will great to display the survival, percentage and category when you
hover over the bars
